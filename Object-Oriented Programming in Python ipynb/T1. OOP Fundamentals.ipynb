    "# Object-Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a widely used programming paradigm that reduces development times—making it easier to read, reuse, and maintain your code. OOP shifts the focus from thinking about code as a sequence of actions to looking at your program as a collection of objects that interact with each other. In this course, you’ll learn how to create classes, which act as the blueprints for every object in Python. You’ll then leverage principles called inheritance and polymorphism to reuse and optimize code. Dive in and learn how to create beautiful code that’s clean and efficient!"

    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the first video, an object-oriented approach is most useful when your code involves complex interactions of many objects. In real production code, classes can have dozens of attributes and methods with complicated logic, but the underlying structure is the same as with the most simple class.\n",

This kind of method, aptly called a setter method, is far from the only possible kind. Methods are functions, so anything you can do with a function, you can also do with a method. For example, you can use methods to print, return values, make plots, and raise exceptions, as long as it makes sense as the behavior of the objects described by the class (an Employee probably wouldn't have a pivot_table() method).\n",
