    "Data scientists can experience huge benefits by learning concepts from the field of software engineering, allowing them to more easily reutilize their code and share it with collaborators. In this course, you'll learn all about the important ideas of modularity, documentation, & automated testing, and you'll see how they can help you solve Data Science problems quicker and in a way that will make future you happy. You'll even get to use your acquired software engineering chops to write your very own Python package for performing text analytics."

You'll quickly learn that using someone else's code is much more pleasant when they use good software engineering practices. In particular, good documentation makes the right way to call a function obvious. In this exercise you'll use python's help() method to view a function's documentation so you can determine how to correctly call a new method.\n",
