    "# Unit Testing for Data Science in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data science project needs unit testing. It comes with huge benefits - saving a lot of development and maintenance time, improving documentation, increasing end-user trust and reducing downtime of productive systems. As a result, unit testing has become a must-have skill in the industry, used by almost every company. This course teaches unit testing in Python using the most popular testing framework pytest. By the end of this course, you will have written a complete test suite for a data science project. In the process, you will learn to write unit tests for data preprocessors, models and visualizations, interpret test results and fix any buggy code. You will also learn advanced concepts like TDD, test organization, fixtures and mocking so that you can test your own data science projects properly."

Throughout the chapter, we will use examples exclusively from the data preprocessing module of a linear regression project, making sure you learn unit testing in the context of data science."
