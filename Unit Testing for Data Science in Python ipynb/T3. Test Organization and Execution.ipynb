    "In any data science project, you quickly reach a point when it becomes impossible to organize and manage unit tests. In this chapter, we will learn about how to structure your test suite well, how to effortlessly execute any subset of tests and how to mark problematic tests so that your test suite always stays green. The last lesson will even enable you to add the trust-inspiring build status and code coverage badges to your own project. Complete this chapter and become a unit testing wizard!"
