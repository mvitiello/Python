    "Merging a table to itself can be useful when you want to compare values in a column to other values in the same column. In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. You have been given a table called crews, which has columns id, job, and name. First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director."

To answer this question, you will merge a modified version of the sequels and financials tables where their index is the movie ID. You will need to choose a merge type that will return all of the rows from the sequels table and not all the rows of financials table need to be included in the result. From there, you will join the resulting table to itself so that you can compare the revenue values of the original movie to the sequel. Next, you will calculate the difference between the two revenues and sort the resulting dataset."
